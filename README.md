# Build Your Own Lisp

This repository contains an implementation of **a** lisp dialect written in C.
The program was created following the guide from the [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/)
book by Daniel Holden and includes some extra features.

This project made me familiarize myself with C and Lisp as well as compiler 
logic.

## Usage

Clone this repository, compile the source code and execute the resulting binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmpargana/BuildYourOwnLisp
cd BuildYourOwnLisp
make
./repl
```

Enjoy Lisp!
